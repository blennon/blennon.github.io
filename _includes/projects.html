			<i class="fa fa-github"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://github.com/blennon/wordsim">Wordsim</a></strong>
			- While taking Robert Hecht-Nielsen's graduate "Neurocomputing" class, he the idea of "context vectors", i.e. distributed representations of words 
			that capture semantic information. I built some models that create these vectors by factoring word co-occurrence matrices. This was before word2vec
			was published but operates on similar principles.

		<h5>
			<i class="fa fa-cog"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>Ph.D. in AI @ UC San Diego</strong>
			- I joined <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Hecht-Nielsen">Professor Robert Hecht-Nielsen's</a> lab at the University of California, San Diego to study
			artificial intelligence and neuroscience. I studied neural networks with an emphasis on the function of the cerebellum.
			I won an NSF scholarship to study in Japan where I collaborated with <a href="http://numericalbrain.org/en/">Professor Tadashi Yamazaki</a>.
			We <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168010218305091?via%3Dihub">proposed</a> a "radical" theory that the cerebellum performs reinforcement learning.
