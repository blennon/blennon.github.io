Foundation models are ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ and now is an incredible time to build a generative AI startup. With the pace of change so fast, what's the best strategy. Here are my thoughts.

# The situation today

## The technology landscape is evolving rapidly 
Three things are happening. 

The first is that the capabilities of existing models like GPT3 are being "discovered" by new prompt engineering techniques like Chain of Thought prompting and Self Ask. We're learning how to squeeze out as much capabilility as possible -- a lot of which is non-obvious.

The second is that new tooling like [Dust](http://Dust.tt), [Everyprompt](https://www.everyprompt.com), LangChain and WebLM are making it easier to develop applications.

Third is that models are improving through innovations in training objectives (e.g. Google's UL2), finetuning (supervised and reinforcement learning through human feedback), multi-modal models and open sourced models like Whisper and Stable Diffusion.

## Foundation models are a new medium
When new mediums are introduced, it takes time for us to figure out how to best utilize them. This is happening now, rapidly, with generative models. Know-how to leverage and apply them is still primitive, but developing. Most engineers and entrepreneurs are still unaware of their capabilities.

## Opportunties are non-obvious
A lot of opportunities to deliver value to customers are non-obvious because we're accustomed to thinking in a pre-generative AI world. In a few years we'll look back and say to ourselves, "why didn't I think of that". More opportunities will be discovered as capabilities become *possible* and *known*. To find those possibilities, you have to "live in future, then build what's missing", as [Paul Graham says](http://paulgraham.com/startupideas.html).

# Strategy
Given the above, how do you setup yourself up for success as a founder in this environment?

I believe *the most important thing is to get to market as fast as possible*.

Here are my operating principles:
- Pick a general direction and go. Pick a direction that's interesting, has founder-market fit and seems opportune. You're heading into an enormous whitespace.
- Move fast & build. More velocity --> more distance covered --> more learning and times at bat. Know-how is invaluable and exploring the space helps prime you to seize the opportunities that become obvious.
- Get to revenue. This forces focus on deliving value to customer. Revenue = proof of value. The market will grow rapidly. Japser.ai, Interiorai.io are great examples of this.
- Experiment & pivot. Look for signal from the market on value, move fast, experiment a lot and move on quickly. Now isn't the time to be spending two years building before launch.
- Don't be afraid to pivot away from a revenue generating product. Startup resources are precious. Revenue can be a distraction if it's from a market that doesn't have huge potential or can't fund growth. Make a judgement call, pat yourself on the back and move on.
- Explore and be curious. There will be a lot of non-obvious things that are valuable. You may find that internal tools you build for youself are valuable to the ecosystem. 
- The trend to AGI is your biggest competitor. GPT-4 might make all of your efforts moot and enable your solution out-of-the-box. Think about other defensible moats.

If you follow these principles, you have a higher liklihood of being sucked into a gravitational well of product-market fit and delivering enduring value.
