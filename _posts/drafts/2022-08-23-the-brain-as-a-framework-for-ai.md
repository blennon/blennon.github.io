When I was in college I read a book that would change the course of my life, "Confabulation Theory: The Mechanism of Thought" by Robert Hecht-Nielsen. Confabulation Theory proposes a theory of cognition and how it is implemented by the brain to carry out vision, hearing, language reasoning, planning, and the origination of movement and thought processes. Hecht-Nielsen goes further and implements this theory in a neural network model to demonstrate it's ability to demonstrate cogent language.

As a was reading it, I remember thinking, "AI is the future". I determined that I needed to know everything about the brain in order to build AI.

# Sutton's Bitter Lesson

> The biggest lesson that can be read from 70 years of AI research is that general methods that leverage computation are ultimately the most effective, and by a large margin.

It's bitter because we pride ourselves on out ability to decode the mechanisms of the brain and design them into our models. But as Sutton

## Enormous progress with differentiable models
The proof of Sutton's lesson is in the incredible progress we've made by employing general methods. End-to-end training of large differentiable models with enormous compute and data has blown away the benchmarks.

# The Brain as a Framework
But Sutton's Bitter Lesson doesn't mean throwing out neuroscience completely. On the contrary, as the only known example of intelligence, researchers use it as a framework for developing artificial intelligence. 

## Strategies over Mechanism
- Reinforcement learning
- Self-supervised learning
- Complementary systems
- Yann LeCun and Geoff Hinton proposals.

## Spiking Neural Networks
The brain is incredibly power efficient in terms of compute.

# General methods inform neuroscience
