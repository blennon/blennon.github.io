Last week GPT-4 was released and a collective wave of excitement and unease washed over the community as we try to make sense of it. Through conversation with lots of smart people like @mbusigin, @oren and others, I’ve formed a mental model to better understand what’s going on.

Imagine floating in the middle of the ocean, staring at an incoming wave. As it approaches, it suddenly sweeps you up, and when you reach its peak, you realize it's not a wave but rather a whole shelf of water. You're now permanently elevated.

Looking in the direction from which the wave came, you see another wave, taller and closer than the previous one. When it arrives, it lifts you to an even higher level. This process continues, with each wave growing taller and arriving faster sweeping you higher at an accelerating rate. If you were to graph this, would look like a bunch of steps that approximates an exponential function when graphed.

This is the reality we face with AI advancements today. The release of the Transformer paper in 2017 was just the first wave, followed by GPT-1, GPT-2, GPT-3, and now GPT-4. If we extrapolate this, we can expect even more significant developments at an accelerating pace.

So, how do we cope with this rapid change? How can we, as entrepreneurs, skate to where the puck is going?

1. Assume progress is accelerating. Think exponential not linear. Assume progress will happen sooner than you think.

2. Push yourself to leverage AI everywhere: AI will be a 10-1000X force multiplier. We need to force ourselves to change our behaviors and practices to adopt AI.

3. Maximize the surface area of GPT-4 in your codebase and product. If you think about the percent of code being written by humans vs AI, the latter is growing quickly and it won’t slow down. At some point a ten year old can click a button and have a bespoke killer app built for them.

4. Stay nimble, be adaptable, and don't be afraid to change tack: In a rapidly evolving landscape, flexibility and adaptability are crucial to staying ahead.

5. Recognize that your own imagination is what will hold you back: Embrace creativity and think outside the box to find innovative ways to harness the power of AI.

6. The biggest source of disruption will be the next wave. Surf it: Stay ahead of the curve by keeping an eye on emerging trends and seizing opportunities as they arise.

7. Enjoy the journey. This is a unique moment in human history.
