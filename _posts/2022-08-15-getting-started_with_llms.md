I've had a few folks ask me what the best way to get started with large language models (LLMs) is so I decided create a post about it.

# Get access to a playground environment. 
You can use OpenAI, AI21, Co:here, or Bloom (on HuggingFace). Each of these will give you free credits to play around. 

Start by playing around and building your intuition for what the models can do.

# Learn prompt engineering techniques
LLMs are incredibly powerful but often require some technique to tease out the desired behavior. [This article](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2022/05/prompt-engineering-in-gpt-3/) provides a high level overview. [This tutorial](https://docs.cohere.ai/prompt-engineering-wiki/) from the Cohere docs is also great.

This is a quickly evolving art and there are a number of "GPT" whisperers out there like [David Shapiro](https://www.youtube.com/c/DavidShapiroAutomator), [Riley Goodside](https://twitter.com/goodside) and [Gwern](gwern.net/GPT-3). I recommend participating in a communities like [/r/GPT3/](https://www.reddit.com/r/GPT3/) and (https://community.openai.com/).

# Learn about how LLMs work under the hood
Read [Jay Alammar's overview of GPT-3](https://jalammar.github.io/how-gpt3-works-visualizations-animations/) and then dive deeper into how the [Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/) architecture works.
