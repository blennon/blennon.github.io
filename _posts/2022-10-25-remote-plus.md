I've been thinking about how I would build my next startup in this new remote-first world.

I see two options:
- building the kernel of the team locally and then expanding to remote
- starting remote-first but adding features to make up for the lack of in-person. I call this Remote+

I haven't settled on one vs the other -- both can work well. I wanted to outline what I see as the pros and cons of both.

## Local kernel, then expand remotely

The energy and enthusiasm of being shoulder to shoulder is incredibly valuable for a nascent team. It helps the team bond, build culture, allows information to flow easily and builds excitement. This is good for morale and progress. 

On the other hand, you miss out on exceptional talent that is available but not local.

## Remote+

With this model you start completely remote and have access to the best talent available Â±3 timezones away.

To make up for the lack of in-person engagement, you add features:

VR Presence. Everyone gets a Quest Pro (or comparable) and meets virtually for 1-2 hours/day. As the technology gets better, the gap between in-person and remote will close.

Monthly meetups. Everyone flies in to a convenient location and works together in a co-working space for a few days.
